            <div class="panel-body">
                During my time at Graebel, I was a member of 2 different teams. In the beginning I played a key role in
                the
                re-development of one of their major brownfield applications,
                tracking the movement of goods around the globe. After this work was released, the team lead got a
                promotion,
                and I was asked to take over many of her responsibilities, including working closely with the broad
                international
                user-base, leading daily stand ups, and planning (with our analyst) for the upcoming sprints. During
                this time,
                I coded
                less, spending more time making sure things got done, tracking velocity, and on boarding new team
                members.

                The next step in my career soon came (still with Graebel), I was offered the opportunity to become part
                of the greenfield development team. I joined an existing team consisting of five of perhaps the most
                talented developers I have ever worked with,. During this time I switched from web forms and WCF to MVC
                and REST. This was an extremely exciting time, and I took the opportunity to learn as much as humanly
                possible.
                I was a member of a team that gave me the opportunity to help develop the enterprise Api (using WebApi)
                tying
                our
                many desparent systems together through the data warehouse, domain driven design concepts, messaging,
                and an
                enterprise service bus. I also had a big role in development of the consuming enterprise portal, joining
                the
                data from all the systems together into a consolidated system for our users. Eventually, the
                organization
                decided to expand their use of Oracle, eliminating our project.

                    After spending several years as a Coldfusion developer, I took a position as a project manager for a

                    CF developers.
                    I oversaw multi-million dollar projects both for the university and the DoD. In this role I learned
                    a lot,
                    I was responsible for the production of my team for better or worse. I stood up for my people, and
                    took the heat when they were wrong. I learned to judge talent, hiring and, unfortunately,
                    sometimes letting people go, always learning as I went.

                <p>
                    Soon it became clear to me that Coldfusion was not the future for myself or my team, so I began
                    migrating
                    the group to Asp.Net and C#
                    Though my official responsibilities did not require me to code, I really liked .Net and took on most
                    infrastructure type work
                    like authentication, authorization, data access and so on.

<!--international-->
<!--user-base, leading daily stand ups, and planning (with our analyst) for the upcoming sprints. During this time,-->

<!--of the greenfield development team. I joined an existing team consisting of five of perhaps the most-->
<!--talented developers I have ever worked with,. During this time I switched from web forms and WCF to MVC-->
<!--and REST. This was an extremely exciting time, and I took the opportunity to learn as much as humanly possible.-->
<!--I was a member of a team that gave me the opportunity to help develop the enterprise Api (using WebApi) tying-->

<!--After spending several years as a Coldfusion developer, I took a position as a project manager for a team of-->
